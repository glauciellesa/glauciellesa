I'm **React developer** whos is passionate about about technology and self-taught. I started 2022 by doing a JavaScript course. During these course I learned front and back end tools like HTML, CSS, Node, Git, Github. Since then I have invested in classes on some other sites like Udemy, linkedin learning and Scrimb, as I am determined to further develop my JavaScript and React skills to progress to a junior front-end developer role.
